title: Hi, I'm Samrat ðŸ‘‹

welcome to my thoughtspace! the world is a crazy place and sometimes I need a place to spill my brain so here I am! be warned, this isn't your typical blog -- you might find my jocular side talking about how dinosaur space aliens will take over the world or perhaps my nerdy side talking about how we can build a more robust future with peer2peer technology. whatever it is, I hope you enjoy this wild journey.

if you would like to learn more about who I am from a professional standpoint, I'll leave my socials below so feel free to give me a shout
