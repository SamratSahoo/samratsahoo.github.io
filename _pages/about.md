**Professional Introduction:** I love using computing to build new paradigms to solve the world's most pressing humanitarian issues. Reinforcement learning, blockchains, distributed systems, robotics, and economics are all fields that excite me! In my free time, you'll find me leading [Bits of Good](https://bitsofgood.org/), where I help nonprofits amplify their impact through computing.

<summary><b>casual introduction (open with caution)</b></summary> welcome to my thought space! the world is a crazy place and sometimes I need a place to spill my brain so you'll find me writing here a lot! be warned, this isn't your typical blog -- you might find my jocular side talking about how dinosaur space aliens will take over the world or perhaps my nerdy side talking about how we can build a more robust future with peer2peer technology. everything in this blog is a free write straight from my thoughts so don't be suprised if you see weird grammar or 20 typos in the same sentence. I hope you enjoy this wild journey.
