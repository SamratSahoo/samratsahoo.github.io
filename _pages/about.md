title: Hi, I'm Samrat

**Professional Introduction:** Hello! I'm Samrat, a recent graduate from the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I studied computer science with concentrations in artificial intelligence and low-level systems. This fall, I'll be pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at Stanford University, focusing on artificial intelligence. I'm especially interested in research, particularly in reinforcement learning and its applications. In the past, my interests have spanned blockchains, federated learning, and economics.

If you'd like to learn more about my past experience, you can find my resume [here](https://samratsahoo.com/Resume_Samrat_Sahoo.pdf).

<summary><b>casual introduction (open with caution)</b></summary> welcome to my thought space! the world is a crazy place and sometimes I need a place to spill my brain so you'll find me writing here a lot! be warned, this isn't your typical blog -- you might find my jocular side talking about how dinosaur space aliens will take over the world or perhaps my nerdy side talking about how we can build a more robust future with peer2peer technology. everything in this blog is a free write straight from my thoughts so don't be suprised if you see weird grammar or 20 typos in the same sentence. I hope you enjoy this wild journey.
